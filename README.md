# unittest_testrail
A nice and easy integration between python unittest and test rail - using decorators for test attributes, base_test module, and global configuration for the means of integrating test runs into test rail.  

## USAGE
you'll want to start by looking at test_controller.py and base_test.py to get examples of how this is used.
you'll find many examples of how this can be applied to a selenium framework, or any other popular automation methods.

see test_modules/**.py for usage of attributes on test methods
